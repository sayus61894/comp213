            <h3><u>What is a Protected Area?</u></h3>
            <p>Due to the development of the modern world, the Earth's geography has changed substantially. Where the world was once green, has become grey. Where there were once trees are now replaced by skyscrapers. <br><br> Protected Areas are minimally influeced by human interaction to preserve the natrual earth. This is accomplished by legal or other effective methods. There are many pacts and laws in place by individual countries, private societies and orgranizations and even the United Nations. This is done in an effort to combat the effects of global warming/climate change. Protected areas are not limited to just forestry, it includes even freshwater.

            <h3><u>International Union for Conservation of Nature</u></h3>
            <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (<a href="https://www.iucn.org/about" target="_blank">IUCN</a>) describes themselves as:</p>
            <blockquote>IUCN is a membership Union composed of both government and civil society organisations. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its more than 1,300 Member organisations and the input of more than 15,000 experts. This diversity and vast expertise makes IUCN the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Their duties extend further than just preserving and monitoring conserved areas. They have also recently expanded into the field of sustainable energy. Furthering research into sustainable energy helps to mitigate the damage that has been done by climate change.</p>

            <h3><u>Canada's Protected Area</u></h3>
            <p>Canda makes a great effort to preserve it's natural land. Canada preserves areas that not only meet the guidelines for protected areas but areas that meet other criteria. In 2018, Canada had preserved roughly 11.2&#37; of it's terrestrial area (land and water), of which around 10.9&#37; was protected areas.</p>
