               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has made our lives easier and has been doing so the time of the wheel. Within the last few years, we have seen a great many technological advances in a shorter span of time than ever due to the exponential growth. In our time we have seen phones go from little handheld bricks to thin, riddled with buttons to touchscreen, capable of only calls or text to video chatting. While these advances have been great, they are a double-edged sword. The advances being referred to are advances in the field of science, computers and information technology. The technological advances, if unchecked, can have detrimental effects on our society, privacy, and the economy.</p>

            <div id="Society">
                <h2 id="societyTitle">Society</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest changes to our society can be considered due to the introduction of social media. While many may not consider social media to be considered technology, because of the programming backing, and that it is a method of passing along information, it can be rightfully considered so. Social media has seen an explosive growth in the popularity since the times of MySpace. Among the most popular are Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Social media is a great way to stay connected and keep up with our loved ones, and to network to meet new people. However social media has a darker side as well. With social media, we have a new way to constantly compare ourselves to others. Being able to share photos is one of the capabilities, but for people who spend an exorbitant amount of time on social media, we end up comparing our peers to ourselves. People only post the “best versions” of themselves online, and being exposed to this its kind of creates a bubble. It’s a bubble we put ourselves in where we compare our current situation, and we fester in it. It can lower one’s self-esteem, makes us feel like we are missing out, and isolated.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers in 2017 studied the use of social media by adolescents and the effects if may have on their mental health. While they noticed that their data pointed towards a negative impact on the mental health of adolescent with increased use, they did not conclusively state that it the sole cause and would require further research and study (Barry et al., 2017). Though not definitive, their research is a starting point and can be taken as a warning. Limiting the use of social media may help users relieve themselves in a psychological state. Even among my own group of friends, we had noticed that the more time we spent on social media, the more inadequate we felt. However, taking a break and avoiding its use, we noticed that we felt happier even after just a week. Social media is a great tool to use, and has many possible uses, but like everything, it should be moderated in it’s use.</p>

            <div id="Privacy">
                <h2 id="privacyTitle">Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology and its advances have made life incredibly convenient. No more are the days of connecting my laptop to the tv to enjoy Netflix, no more do I need to open a browser to search for something or shop. All these conveniences come at a cost though, and it is usually our privacy. We unknowingly and even willingly give up our privacy in the form of data when we use technology. Companies like Google and Facebook, track what sites we visit, what we shop for, what we like and using this information can create a predictable model of ourselves. In an editorial piece in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the authors state “more sensitive derivations may be made, such as most probable religion or sexual preference. These derivations could then in turn lead to inequal treatment or discrimination.” (van de Hoven, Blaauw, Pieters and Warnier, 2019). Here derivations are referring to the model or profiles that companies may make and use based on the information that they have collected. The data or even the model may not need to be used by the company that gathers it. Through the use of their services we agree blindly to their terms and conditions. These terms may state that they own the right to the information and may use it how they see fit, meaning they may sell to the highest bidder. The highest bidder could be anyone: other corporations, governments or worse yet a hate group. Not all groups mining for our private information may use it in a negative way, some may use it cater apps, or events to their clients, but the possibility for bad still exists and may even outweigh the good.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many different means of collecting information are employed today, all forms of technology that we use to make our lives easier. These include the internet, security cameras, our cellphones, and smart devices.</p>

            <div id="Economy">
                <h2 id="economyTitle">Economy</h2>
                <p>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furthering of technology impacts the economy as well; good for the people at the top, harmful for the 99%-ers. Use of technology unimpeded could further the societal gap between the rich and the poor.

                <h3 id="robots">
                    Robots
                </h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robots make routine jobs easier to do, but at the same time cost people their jobs. In an online article published on BBC News by Jonty Bloom (2019), he stated that the ONS (Office for National Statistics in the UK) predicts that 1.5 million jobs will be lost to robots. Oxford Economics predicts that by the year 2030 roughly 20 million jobs will be lost, with majority of the losses in the China (2019). While most the jobs lost will be in the manufacturing sector, there is no guarantee that it will not impede into the service sector or even further. With many jobs being lost to automation, and the population increasing at the current rate, it is possible that the socioeconomic gap will increase further. The safer jobs require further education, however without funding (from jobs) continuing with school will be a struggle. The financially well off will succeed while those less fortunate will find it difficult to keep up with the demands of the job market.

                <h3 id="CRISPR">CRISPR</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene editing is a form of technology that is exciting in its capabilities. CRISPR allows the user to find a specific part of the DNA and edit it as the user wants. This technology can be used to deal with diseases, and may possible be able to save lives. However, we will consider the darker capabilities and their consequences. As the technology will further develop, it will become cheaper and more accessible for other uses rather than medical. The technology may eventually be used create “designer babies.” Ori Chalom in a module (n.d.) designed to interest high school students in bioethics addressed this exactly in his discussion about CRISPR and eugenics. The module acknowledges that society has a physically preference and with the introduction of CRISPR, we could make babies that fit this standard, thus creating the “perfect human.” Now in a hypothetical sense, what if we develop our knowledge to pinpoint the sections of DNA that dictates how well we retain knowledge, or how well we physically perform? Coupling that advancement with CRISPR we could create humans that are smarter, more physically capable than natural born babies. With the expense though, not everyone will be able to afford the use, only the rich and powerful. This could potentially create a larger gap than we currently have in terms of socioeconomics. The rich will get richer and flourish at greater lengths, while the poorer in comparison will not benefit from it at all.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darker capabilities of CRISPR mimic a show that I watched as a kid, an anime called Gundam Seed. Within that universe, there were two “races” of humans: coordinators and naturals. Coordinators are the equivalent of the hypothetical designer babies, while naturals were humans born without any gene editing. The two races of humans were at war with each other which stemmed from a hate for each other and their superior attitude over the other. This brings in a way brings it back to the affect on society. The show can be seen as a warning of what may occur if the technological advances of CRISPR go unregulated.</p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has made our lives much easier and convenient. It is exciting to see where it goes and what we are capable of because of it. We have seen many advancements; however, it comes at costs to our society as a whole, our privacy and the economy. Just because something may be possible does not mean we need to pursue it. Advancing technology comes at a cost, thus a step back must be taken to consider the possible risks and consequences of our actions. Even if we do not, some governing board must take responsibility for the betterment of humankind.
